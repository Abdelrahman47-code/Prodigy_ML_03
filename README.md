## Food Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview:
This is the repo for my third task at the ML Virtual Internship from [Prodigy InfoTech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodigy-infotech/). This project focuses on classifying food images into 10 different categories using deep learning techniques. It involves various components, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Key Features:
- Data Preparation: Randomly selected 10 food classes, displayed sample images for each class.
- Model Architecture: Explored custom CNN and leveraged pre-trained models like VGG16 and MobileNet.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Used Keras Tuner to find the best model hyperparameters.
- Data Augmentation: Employed ImageDataGenerator for robust model training.
- Evaluation and Visualization: Evaluated models, visualized metrics, and analyzed training history.
